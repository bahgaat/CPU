CPU: A two-stage pipelined CPU that runs the RISC-V instruction set using logisim (educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits).

●  Designed, built, and pipelined a CPU (both the datapath and control logic) that runs the RISC-V instruction set.                                                                                                     
● Encountered many difficult design decisions (especially in designing control logic) and was able to come up with good design solutions that facilitated building the entire cpu.
